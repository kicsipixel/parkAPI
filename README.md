# parkAPI - code for the tutorial
This is the code for the [https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird](Hummingbird) tutorial. It is a lightweight, flexible server framework written in Swift. Hummingbird consists of three main components, the core HTTP server, a minimal web application framework and the extension modules.

This branch uses PostgreSQL database, so either you need to install it on your computer or you need to run: ```docker-compose up```.

After starting the database, you can run the server: ```swift run parkAPI``.
